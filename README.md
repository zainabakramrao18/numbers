### ✅ `README.md` (for Largest Number Finder)

```markdown
# 🔢 Largest Number Finder

This is a simple Python program that asks the user to input **four numbers** and determines the **largest** among them using the built-in `max()` function.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Accepts 4 numeric inputs from the user  
- ✅ Uses Python's `max()` function for comparison  
- ✅ Handles invalid (non-numeric) inputs gracefully  
- ✅ Displays the result clearly  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly and cleanly structured  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter four numbers  
2. It uses `max(num1, num2, num3, num4)` to find the largest  
3. It then prints the largest number on the screen  
4. If the user enters non-numeric input, an error message appears

## 📂 Example

```text
Enter first number: 4.2  
Enter second number: 9.1  
Enter third number: 6.7  
Enter fourth number: 3.3  
✅ The largest number is: 9.1
```
